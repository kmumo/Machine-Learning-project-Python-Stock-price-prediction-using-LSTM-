# Machine-Learning-project-Python-Stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM-
I am developing a stock price prediction machine learning project using LSTM in Python. I want to acknowledge DataFlair for providing both the dataset and the initial source code. I have made corrections to the code obtained from DataFlair to address certain errors in my implementation.
